######### USER STORIES ##########

```
As someone who is good at not doing things,
So that I can feel good about my skill,
I want to be able to make a list of things I want to not do.

As a user of the Don't Do List,
So that I can keep track of what I haven't done,
I want to be able to remove tasks I have successfully not done.

As a user of the Don't Do List,
So that I can update my tasks,
I want to be able to edit the To Don't List.

As a user of the Don't Do List,
When I am struggling to not complete tasks,
I want some extra motivation.
